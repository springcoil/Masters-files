\section{Lie groups}
   Lie groups are groups which are also differentiable manifolds, in which the group operations are smooth.
   Well-known examples are the general linear group, the unitary group, the orthogonal group and the 
   special linear group. 
 \begin{definition}
  A \textit{Lie group} G is a differential manifold with group structure such that the map $G \times G \rightarrow G$
  given by $(g,h) \Rightarrow gh^{-1}$ is $C^\infty$.
 \end{definition}
\begin{definition}
 A \textit{Lie algebra} $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\Rbb$ is a real vector space $\mathfrak{g}$ together with a bilinear
 operator $[\cdot,\cdot]: \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathfrak{g}$ (the \textit{bracket}) such that
 for all $x,y,z \in \mathfrak{g}$, 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item [x,y] = -[y,x]                         (anti-commutativity)
  \item [[x,y],z] + [[y,z],x] + [[z,x],y] = 0 (Jacobi identity)
 \end{enumerate}

\end{definition}
We will see that there is a Lie algebra associated to each Lie group, and that every connected, simply connected (i.e. 
the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(G)$ is trivial) Lie group is determined up to isomorphism by its Lie algebra. The study
of such Lie groups then reduces to a study of their Lie algebras. 
\begin{definition}
 Let $\varphi: M \rightarrow N$ be $C^{\infty}$. Smooth vector fields X on M and Y on N are $\varphi$-related if $d \varphi \circ X = Y \circ \varphi$,
 which is short for $(d\varphi)_{p}(X_{p}) = Y_{\varphi(p)}$ for all $p \in M$.
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
 Let $\varphi: M \rightarrow N$ be $C^{\infty}$. Let $X_{1}$ and $X_2$ be smooth vector fields on M,
 and let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be smooth vector fields on N. If $X_{i}$ is $\varphi-related$ to $Y_{i}$, i =1,2, then 
 $[X_1,X_2]$ is $\varphi$-related to $[Y_1,Y_2]$.
 \end{exercise}

 \begin{proof}
  Let us consider a smooth $\varphi:M \rightarrow N$, and let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be smooth vector fields on M and let 
  $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ be smooth vector fields on N.
 Let $d\varphi \circ X_1 = Y_1 \circ \varphi$ and 
 $d \varphi \circ X_2 = Y_2 \circ \varphi$
 Then $d\varphi \circ (X_1 X_2 - X_2 X_1)$
 \\ $\Rightarrow d\varphi \circ X_1 X_2 - d\varphi X_2 X_1$
 \\ $\Rightarrow Y_1 \circ \varphi(d\varphi \circ X_2) - Y_2 \circ \varphi(d\varphi \circ X_1)$
 \\ $\Rightarrow Y_1Y_2 \circ \varphi - Y_2 Y_1 \circ \varphi$
 \\ $\Rightarrow (Y_1Y_2 - Y_2Y_1) \circ \varphi$
 $\Rightarrow [Y_1, Y_2] \circ \varphi$\\
 So we have proved that $X_{i}$ is $\varphi$-related to $Y_i$, i=1,2, then $[X_1,X_2]$ is $\varphi$-related to $[Y_1,Y_2]$ 
 \end{proof}

\begin{definition}
 Let G be a Lie group and $g \in G$. Left translation $l_{g}$ and right translation $r_{g}$ by g are diffeomorphism of G
 given by 
 \begin{equation*}
  l_g h = gh \quad r_g = hg,\;\;\;\;\; for \; all\; h \in G
 \end{equation*}
A vector field X on G is called \textit{left-invariant} if X is $l_g$-related to itself for all $g \in G$, that is \\
\begin{center}$dl_g \circ X = X \circ l_g,$ \end{center}
 which is short for \;\;\;\;\;\;\; \begin{center}$dl_g(X_h) = X_{gh}$ for all $h \in G$.\end{center}
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}\label{Prop1}
 Let G be a Lie group and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a set of left-invariant vector fields. 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\mathfrak{g}$ is a real vector space, and the map $\alpha: \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow T_{e}G$ defined by $\alpha(X) = X(e)$
  is an isomorphism of $\mathfrak{g}$ with the tangent space $T_{e}G$ of G at the identity. Consequently $dim(\mathfrak{g}) = 
  dim(G)$.
  \item Left invariant vector fields are smooth
  \item The Lie bracket of two left-invariant vector fields is a left invariant vector field
  \item $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation of vector fields.
 \end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
 It is not difficult to see that $\mathfrak{g}$ is a real vector space and that $\alpha$ is linear. Since 
 $\alpha(X) = \alpha(Y)$ yields 
 \begin{equation*}
  X_{g} = dl_g(X_e) = dl_g(\alpha(X)) = dl_g(\alpha(Y)) = dl_g(Y_e) = Y_g \;\;\;\;\;for\;each\;g\in G,
 \end{equation*}
$\alpha$ is injective. In order to see the surjectivity of $\alpha$ let $v \in T_e G$ and define 
\begin{center}
 \begin{equation*}
  X_g = dl_g(v) \;\;\;for\;all\; g,h \in G
 \end{equation*}
 \end{center}
This proves part (1). 
   \\ For (2) let $X \in \mathfrak{g}$ and $f \in C^{\infty}(G)$. We need to show that Xf $\in C^{\infty}(G)$. 
  Let $\varphi: G \times G \rightarrow G$ be a smooth map given by multiplication $\varphi(g,h) = gh$. Let $i^{1}_{e}$ and
  $i^{2}_{g}$ be the smooth maps $G \rightarrow G \times G$ given by $i^{1}_{e}(h) = (h,e)$ and $i^{2}_{g}(h) = (g,h)$
 Let Y be any smooth vector field on G with $Y_e = X_e$. Then $[(0,Y)(f\circ \varphi)]\circ i^{1}_e$ is smooth and 
\begin{center}
 \begin{equation*}
  [(0,Y)(f\circ \varphi)]\circ i^{1}_e(g) = (0,Y)_{(g,e)}(f\circ \varphi)
\end{equation*}\begin{equation*} = 0_{g}(f\circ \varphi \circ i^{1}_{e}) + Y_{e}(f\circ \varphi \circ i^{2}_{g})\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\hfill = X_{e}(f\circ \varphi \circ i^2_{g}) = X_{e}(f\circ l_{g})\end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
\hfill = dl_{g}(X_{e})f = X_{g} f = Xf(g)
 \end{equation*}
which proves part (2).
   Since by (2), left-invariant vector fields are smooth, their Lie brackets are defined and by simple checking they 
   are again left-invarint, which shows (3). (4) follows from (3) and by the fact that \textbf{The vector space of all smooth 
   vectors fields under the Lie bracket on vector fields is a Lie algebra}
\end{center}

\qed
\end{proof}

\end{proposition}
\begin{definition}
 We define the \textit{Lie algebra of the Lie group G} to be the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of left-invariant vector fields
 on G
\end{definition}
Often it will be convenient to think of the $T_{e} G$ as the Lie algerba of G with the Lie algebra stricture induced by the 
isomorphism $\alpha$ form Proposition \ref{Prop1}(1).
\begin{example}
 The real line  $\Rbb$ is a Lie group under addition. The left-invariant fields are simply the constant vector
 fields $\left\lbrace\lambda(\dfrac{d}{dr})|\lambda \in \Rbb\right\rbrace$. The bracket of any two such vector fields is 0.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
 The Lie group \Gl = $\det^{-1}(\Rbb \ {0})$ is a (differentiable) submanifold of 
 \gl. \Gl has global coordinates $A_{ij}$ which assigns to each matrix A the ij-th entry. Since
 $\det(A^{-1})= \det(A)^{-1}$ and $\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$ for any A,B $\in$ \Gl, the matrix 
 $AB^{-1}$ is invertible with the ij-th entry $(AB^{-1})_{ij}$ being a rational function in the entries
 of A and B with non-zero denominator. Therefore $(A,B) \mapsto AB^{-1}$ is $C^{\infty}$
 \\\;\;\;Consider the isomorphisms $\alpha: \mathfrak{g} \rightarrow T_{e}G$ from Proposition $\ref{Prop1}$(1). Since $T_e\Gl$
 = $T_e\gl$ and the map $\beta: T_e\gl \rightarrow \gl$ given by $\beta(v)_{ij}:= v_{ij}$ is a (canonical) isomorphism, 
 $\beta\circ \alpha$ induces a Lie algebra structure on \gl. We leave it as an exercise to show that the bracket agrees with the
 usual $[A,B] = AB - BA$. 
\end{example}
Taking the example above as a starting point, we can create other examples. The non-singular matrices $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ of all 
n $\times$ n complex matrices $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$ is a Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{C})$.
If V is an n-dimensional real vector space, a basis of V determines a diffeomorphism from End(V) to \gl sending Aut(V) onto 
\Gl. In this way End(V) is a Lie group from Lie algebra Aut(V). We get an analog example for complex case vector spaces.
 \\ The special linear group \Sl, the Unitary group U(n), the special unitaroy group \Su are the most important examples
 for us. 
 \subsection{Homomorphisms}
 \begin{definition}
  A map $\varphi:G \rightarrow H$ is a (Lie group) homomorphism if $\varphi$ is both $C^{\infty}$ and a homomorphism of groups.
  We call $\varphi$ an \textit{isomorphism} if $\varphi$ is also a diffeomorphism. 
  If $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ are Lie algebras, a map $\psi:\mathfrak{g} \rightarrow \mathfrak{h}$ is a 
  \textit{(Lie algebra) homomorphism} if it is linear and it preserves brackets ($\psi[X,Y]=[\psi(X),\psi(Y)]$ for all 
  X,Y $\in \mathfrak{g}$). If $\psi$ is also a bijection, then $\psi$ is an \textit{isomorphism}.
 \end{definition}
Let $\varphi:G \rightarrow H$ be a homomorphism. Then $\varphi$ maps the identity of G to the identity of H, and the differential
$d \varphi$ of $\varphi$ is a linear transformation of $\mathfrak{g}=T_{e}G$ into $\mathfrak{h} = T_e H$. Notice that by the natural
identification between Lie algebras and left-invariant vector fields $d\varphi(X)$ is the unique left-invariant vector field
satisfying 
\begin{equation}\label{2.3.1}
 (d\varphi(X))_e = d\varphi_e(X_e).
\end{equation}
\begin{theorem}\label{2.3.2}
 Let G and H Lie groups with Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ and $\mathfrak{h}$ respectively, and let $\varphi:G \rightarrow H$
 be a homomorphism. Then
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item X and $d\varphi(X)$ are $\varphi$-related for each $X \in \mathfrak{g}$.
  \item d$\varphi$: $\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow \mathfrak{h}$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism. 
 \end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 The left-invariant vector fields $d \varphi(X)$ and X are $\varphi$-related to, because 
 \begin{equation*}
  (d\varphi(X))_{\varphi(g)} = dl){\varphi(g)}d\varphi_{e}(X_e) = d(l_{\varphi(g)}\circ \varphi)X_{e} = d(\varphi \circ l_{g})X_{e} = d\varphi(X_{g}).
 \end{equation*}
 To show part (2), let $X,Y \in \mathfrak{g}$. By an exercise result [X,Y] is $\varphi$-related to the 
 left invariant vector field [$d\varphi(X), d\varphi(Y)$], that is 
 \begin{equation*}
  (d\varphi([X,Y]))_{e} \stackrel{\ref{2.3.1}}{=} d\varphi_{e}([X,Y]_e) = [d\varphi(X),d\varphi(Y)]_{\varphi(e)} = [d\varphi(X),d\varphi(Y)]_{e}
 \end{equation*}
Therefore using the identification of left-invariant vector fields with tangent vectors at the identity,
$d\varphi([X,Y])=[d\varphi(X), d\varphi(Y)].$\footnote{We had to be careful not to mix up notations, we had to take a detour via the tangent
space at e, because of how $\varphi$-related was defined}
 
\qed
\end{proof}
\subsection{Lie subgroups}
\begin{definition} $(H,\phi)$ is a \textit{Lie subgroup} of the Lie group G if 
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item H is a Lie group;
  \item $(H,\varphi)$ is a submanifold of G;
  \item $\varphi: H \rightarrow G$ is a Lie group homomorphism.
 \end{enumerate}
$(H,\varphi)$ is called a \textit{closed subgroup} of G if $\phi(H)$ is also a closed subset of G.
\end{definition}
  Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie algebra. A subspace $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ if [X,Y] $\in \mathfrak{h}$ for all
  X,Y $\in \mathfrak{h}$.
 \paragraph{}
 Let $(H,\phi)$ be a Lie subgroup of G, and let $\mathfrak{h}$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ be their respective Lie algebras. Then
 by Theorem (\ref{2.3.2}) $d \varphi$ yields and isomorphism between $\mathfrak{h}$ and the Lie subalgebra $d\varphi(\mathfrak{h})$
 of $\mathfrak{g}$.
 We will show in this section one of the fundamental theorems in Lie group theory, which asserts that there is a 1:1 
 correspondence between connected Lie subgroups of a Lie group and subalgebras of its Lie algebra.
 We need the following two propositions.
 \begin{proposition}
 Let G be a connected Lie group, and let U be a neighbourhood of e. Then
 \begin{equation*}
  G = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty U^n
 \end{equation*}
where $U^n$ consists of all n-fold products of elements of U. 
\begin{proof}
 Let us consider V:=$U \cup U^{-1}\;(where\;U^-1\;=\;\left\lbrace g^{-1} \in U| g \in U \right\rbrace$)
 and let 
 \begin{equation*}
  H := \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} V^n \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U^n.
 \end{equation*}
 H is a subgroup of G and open in G, since $h \in H$ implies $hV \in H$. Therefore each coset of H is also open in G.
 Since 
 \begin{equation*}
  H = G \ \bigcup_{g \in G, gH \neq H}^{\infty} gH,
 \end{equation*}
H is also closed. Since H is non-empty and G is connected we get G = H
\qed
\end{proof}

 \end{proposition}
Recall that a \textit{k-dimensional distribution} $\D$ on a manifold M is a choice of a k-dimensional
linear subspace $\D_{p} \subset T_p M.$ A distribution is \textit{smooth}, if it is locally spanned by smooth 
vector fields $X_1,\cdots,X_k,$ or equivalently if $\D$ is a smooth subbundle of Tm. A smooth distribution
is \textit{involutive} if $[X,Y] \in \D$ for any smooth vector fields X,Y $\in \D$. It is \textit{completely
integrable}, if for each point $p \in M$ there is an integral manifold N of $\D$ passing through p,
where N is intergral if 
\begin{equation*}
 N \stackrel{i}{\rightarrow} M\; and\; di_{p}(T_{p}N) = D_{p} \; for \; each\; p \in N
\end{equation*}
A smooth coordinate chart (U, $\phi$) is flat for $\D$, if 
$\phi(U) = U' \times U''\subset \Rbb^k \times \Rbb^{n - k}$, and at
points of U, $\D$ is spanned by the first k coordinate vector fields 
$\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^1} , \cdots , \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^k}$ . This implies
that each slice of the form $x^{k+1} = c^{k+1} , \cdots, x^n = c^n$ for constants $c^i$ is an integral manifold
of $\D$. Beware that the terminology is inconsistent among various books. However, we will
show the famous Frobenius’ Theorem which states that terminology is of no consequence.
Before that we need to recall a few definitions and prove a few lemmas.
\begin{definition}. Let $\M$ be a smooth manifold and let X be a vector field on $\M$ .
(1) An integral curve of X is a smooth curve $\gamma : J \rightarrow \M$ with $J \subset \Rbb$ an open interval
such that
$\dot{\gamma}(t) = X_{\gamma}(t)$ for all $t \in J$.
If $\theta \in J$, then $\gamma(\theta)$ is the starting point.
(2) Let $\theta(p) : \D(p) \rightarrow \M$ be the \textit{maximal integral curve} with starting point p.
(3) The flow of X is the map $\theta :\D \rightarrow \M$ given by $\theta_{t} (p) = \gamma_{p} (t)$ for (t, p) in the domain
$ \D := \left\lbrace(\D^{(p)} , p) | p \in M \right\rbrace$.
(4) X is called complete if the domain of its flow is $\Rbb \times \M$.
\end{definition}
\subsection{Killing forms}
Consider a \textit{Lie algebra} \gg over a field $\Kbb$. Every element x of \gg defines the 
\textbf{adjoint endomorphism} $\textrm{ad}(x)$ of \gg as 

$\textrm{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]. $

Now, supposing \gg is of finite dimension, the trace of the composition of two such endomorphisms defines a 
\textit{symmetric
bilinear form}
\\
B(x, y) = trace(ad(x)$\circ$ad(y))

with values in K, the \textbf{Killing form} on \gg

The Killing form for some Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$ are (for $X, Y \in \mathfrak{g}$):

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
          $\mathfrak{g}$              & B(X,Y)                                  \\ \hline
        $\mathfrak{gl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ & 2$\mathrm{tr}(XY) - 2\mathrm{tr}(X)tr(Y)$ \\ 
        $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{R})$ & 2n$\mathrm{tr}(XY)$                       \\ 
        $\mathfrak{su}(n)$            & 2n$\mathrm{tr}(XY)$                       \\ 
        $\mathfrak{so}(n,\mathbb{C})$ & (n-2)$\mathrm{tr}(XY)$                    \\ 
        $\mathfrak{sp}(n,\mathbb{R})$ & (2n+2)$\mathrm{tr}(XY)$                   \\ 
        $\mathfrak{sp}(n,\mathbb{C})$ & (2n+2)$\mathrm{tr}(XY)$                   \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
See \cite{fulton_representation_1991} for the Representation theory of Lie groups.
\subsection{Classifying spaces}
Classifying spaces are one of the more important notions of modern Algebraic Topology, particularly Homotopical Algebra, see \cite{hatcher_algebraic_2001} 
and references therein. We introduce the notion and an important theorem without proof.
\begin{theorem}[Milnor]
 Let G be a topological group. There exists a classifying space for G. 
\end{theorem}
BG is well-defined only up to 'homotopy equivalence'.
In algebraic topology one considers the \textit{classifying space} BG of a topological group G. By definition this 
is the quotient of a contractible space EG on which G acts freely. Thus there is a fibration 
$G \rightarrow EG \rightarrow BG$. For a Lie group G we can approximate EG by finite dimensional manifolds. 
Isomorphism classes of G bundles over a space X are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps from X to BG.
\begin{example}
 If G = U(n) then BG is the Grassmanian of n-planes in $\Cbb^{\infty}$, which for our purposes can be studied by taking
 n-planes in $\Cbb^{N}$ for sufficiently lare N, in any given problem or calculation.
\end{example}
\textbf{Borel's theorem}
Suppose we have a spectral sequence (of vector spaces over a field k of characteristic zero) with 
\begin{equation*}
 E^{p,q}_{2} = A^q \tensor B^p
\end{equation*}
where A is an exterior algebra on generators $e_i \in A^{2l_{i}}$, B is an algebra $B^0 = k$ and the sequence is compatible
with products. Suppose $E^{p,q}_{\infty} = 0$ for p+q > 0. Then B is a polynomial algebra on generators $b_i$ in dim $2l_i$.
The $b_i = d_{d_{l_{i}}e_{i}$.
It follows that for a compact Lie group G $H^*(BG)$ is a polynomial algebr, as above. For the classical groups G we see that $H^*(BG)$
has generators as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item U(n): generators $c_i \in H^{2i}$ for i = 1,...,n
 \item Sp(n); generators $p_i \in H^{4i}$ for i = 1,...,n
 \item SO(2n+1) generators $p_i \in H^{4i}$ for i = 1,...,n
\end{itemize}
