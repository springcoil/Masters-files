\section{}
\texttt{This is Inconsolata}
But perfect control is rarely assured in any free market, not with code or any-
thing else.
This is a hard fact for lawyers to understand (protected as they are by
exclusionary rules such as the bar exam), but most of production in our so-
ciety occurs without any guarantee of government protection. Starbucks
didn’t get a government monopoly before it risked a great deal of capital
to open coffee shops around the world. All it was assured was that people
would have to pay for the coffee they sold; the idea of a high-quality coffee
shop was free for others to take. Similarly, chip fabricators around the world
invest billions in chip production plants, with no assurance from the
government that another competitor won’t open a competing plant right
next door.
