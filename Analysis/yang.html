\newpage To define the Yang-Mills Lagrangian, we need to define the 'Trace' of an End(E) valued form. Recall that the Trace of a maTrix is the sum of its diagonal enTries. The Trace is independent of the choice of basis - an invariant notion that is independent of the choice of basis. A definition of the Trace that mkes this clear is as follows. Consider $latex {End(V) \simeq V \otimes V^*}&fg=000000$ - an isomorphism that does not depend on any choice of basis - so the pairing between V and $latex {V^*}&fg=000000$ defines a linear map \begin{equation*} Tr: End(V) \To \Rbb \end{equation*} \begin{equation*} v \otimes f \mapsto f(v) \end{equation*} To see that this v is really a Trace, pick $latex {e_i}&fg=000000$ of V and let $latex {\epsilon^j}&fg=000000$ be a dual basis of $latex {V^*}&fg=000000$. Writing $latex {T \;\in\; End(V)}&fg=000000$ as \begin{equation*} T = T^i_j e_i \otimes \epsilon^j \end{equation*} We have \begin{equation*} Tr(T) = T^i_je_i(\epsilon^j) = T^i_j \delta_i^j = T^i_i \end{equation*} which is of course the sum of the diagonal enTries. \newline This implies that if we have a section T of $latex {End(E),}&fg=000000$ we can define a funciton Tr(T) on the base manifold M whose value at $latex {p \in M}&fg=000000$ is the Trace of the endomorphism T(p) of the fiber $latex {E_p}&fg=000000$: \begin{equation*} Tr(T)(p) = Tr(T(p)) \end{equation*} If $latex {T \in \Gamma(End(E))}&fg=000000$ and $latex {\omega \in \Omega^p(M)}&fg=000000$ we define <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle Tr(T \otimes \omega) = Tr(T)\omega&fg=000000$</p>
 Now we can write down the <b>Yang-Mills Lagrangian</b>: If D is a connection on E, this is the n-form given by <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle  \mathcal{L}_{YM} = \frac{1}{2} Tr(F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F) \ \ \ \ \ (1)&fg=000000$</p>
 where F is the curvature of D. Note that by the defintion of the hodge star operator (also in this collection of notes), we can write this in local co-ordinates as <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle  \mathcal{L}_{YM} = \frac{1}{4} Tr (F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu})vol \ \ \ \ \ (2)&fg=000000$</p>
 If we integrate $latex {\mathcal{L}_{YM}}&fg=000000$ over M we get the <b>Yang-Mills action</b> <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle  S_YM = \frac{1}{2} \int_M Tr (F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F) \ \ \ \ \ (3)&fg=000000$</p>
 This needs some elaboration. So let us explain these formulas better. We choose the physics convention $latex {F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu -ig[A_\mu,A_\nu]}&fg=000000$ where the generators of the Lie algebra are Hermitian. <p align=center>$latex \displaystyle  \mathcal{L}_{YM} = \mathcal{I} = - \int Tr(F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F) \ \ \ \ \ (4)&fg=000000$</p>
 by another convention (there is a lot of ambiguity of signs in this subject). The first thing to note is that F has vector <b>and</b> Lie algebra indices. The Trace is over the Lie algebra, <b>not</b> over the vector indices. The vector indices are just those of the field sTrength in QED. In Yang-Mills the curvature form is Lie Algebra valued. \newline In this case $latex {F_{\mu \nu} = F^{a}_{\mu \nu}T^a}&fg=000000$ where the summation convention is used,and where $latex {T^a}&fg=000000$ are the generators of $latex {\mathfrak{su}(n)}&fg=000000$. To be explicit, F has not only tensor components but maTrix components \begin{equation*} (F_{\mu \nu})_{ij} = F^{a}_{\mu \nu}T^a T^a_{ij} \end{equation*} The inner product of F with itself $latex {&lt;F,F&gt; = \int F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F}&fg=000000$ where \textasteriskcentered is the Hodge \textasteriskcentered - operator. Thus we are calculating $latex {\mathcal{I} = -Tr&lt;F,F&gt;}&fg=000000$. It is a standard exercise to find the exterior product of two r-forms. We find \begin{equation*} F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F = \frac{1}{2!}F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu} dx^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge dx^4 \end{equation*} Note that the differential forms don't 'know' the Lie algebra. The algebra hasn't come into the calcuation yet. $latex {Tr(F_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu})=Tr(F^{a}_{\mu \nu}T^aF^{\mu \nu b}T^b}&fg=000000$ $latex {= Tr(T^aT^b)F^{a}_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu b}}&fg=000000$ $latex {= \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}F^{a}_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu b}}&fg=000000$ $latex {=\frac{1}{2}F^{a}_{\mu \nu}F^{\mu \nu a}}&fg=000000$ where e have used the standard normalization convention for the $latex {T^a}&fg=000000$, $latex {Tr T^a T^b = \frac{1}{2}\delta^{ab}}&fg=000000$. (This comes from the fact we want $latex {\mathfrak{su}(2)}&fg=000000$ to live in $latex {\mathfrak{su}(n)}&fg=000000$, and the generators of $latex {\mathfrak{su}(2)}&fg=000000$ are taken to be $latex {T^a = \frac{\sigma^a}{2}}&fg=000000$ where $latex {\sigma^a}&fg=000000$ are the Pauli matrices.) Thus, we find \begin{equation*} \mathcal{I} = - Tr (F \wedge \textasteriskcentered F) \end{equation*} which can be written as \begin{equation*} \frac{1}{4} \int d^4 x F^{a}_{\mu \nu}F^{a \mu \nu} \end{equation*}
